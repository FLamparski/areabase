Areabase is...
==============

Areabase is a project to create an Android app to bring UK census and police data into one place (also tells you how good or bad your area is)

...but it also is...
--------------------

Areabase also happens to be my A-level Computing practical project, and due to the limitations imposed by the exam board, I cannot accept pull requests :(

So, what are the features?
--------------------------

* *ONS Neighbourhood statistics* is used to fetch most of the data about an area.
* *Police data API* is used to get detailed crime data
* *Other data* will be used as well
* *GPS* will allow you to view data about your immediate neighbourhood instantly
* *AreaRank* will be a ranking service rating areas on the scale from 1 to 10.
* The user interface will have a *summary view* with *cards* showing you chunks of information in a manageable, natural-language form
* Designed according to emergent industry trends, etc.

What's in the repo?
-------------------

Eclipse projects containing Areabase itself, together with its dependencies, as well as other code that will eventually find its way into Areabase but lives separately for now.
