Or not, who knows at this point.\r\n* *GPS* will allow you to view data about your immediate neighbourhood instantly\r\n* *AreaRank* will be a ranking service rating areas on the scale from 1 to 10.\r\n* The user interface will have a *summary view* with *cards* showing you chunks of information in a manageable, natural-language form\r\n* Designed according to emergent industry trends, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat's in the repo?\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nEclipse projects containing Areabase itself, together with its dependencies, as well as other code that will eventually find its way into Areabase but lives separately for now.\r\n\r\n### License(s)\r\n\r\n**Areabase**, and all of its components that I wrote, is licensed, at least for now, under [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).\r\n\r\n**NDE2ImplTesting**, the stuff I wrote, is licensed under [BSD 2-clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause).
