<p>Areabase is a project to create an Android app to bring UK census and police data into one place (also tells you how good or bad your area is)</p>

<h2>
<a name="but-it-also-is" class="anchor" href="#but-it-also-is"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>...but it also is...</h2>

<p>Areabase also happens to be my A-level Computing practical project, and due to the limitations imposed by the exam board, I cannot accept pull requests :(</p>

<h2>
<a name="so-what-are-the-features" class="anchor" href="#so-what-are-the-features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So, what are the features?</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<em>ONS Neighbourhood statistics</em> is used to fetch most of the data about an area.</li>
<li>
<em>Police data API</em> is used to get detailed crime data</li>
<li>
<em>Other data</em> will be used as well. Or not, who knows at this point.</li>
<li>
<em>GPS</em> will allow you to view data about your immediate neighbourhood instantly</li>
<li>
<em>AreaRank</em> will be a ranking service rating areas on the scale from 1 to 10.</li>
<li>The user interface will have a <em>summary view</em> with <em>cards</em> showing you chunks of information in a manageable, natural-language form</li>
<li>Designed according to emergent industry trends, etc.</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="whats-in-the-repo" class="anchor" href="#whats-in-the-repo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's in the repo?</h2>

<p>Eclipse projects containing Areabase itself, together with its dependencies, as well as other code that will eventually find its way into Areabase but lives separately for now.</p>
