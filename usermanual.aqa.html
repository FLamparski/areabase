                <h2>Why Areabase <small>Easy data</small></h2>
                <p>Everyone needs statistical geography for one reason or another. Moving houses? Check for crime data. Interested in demographics?
                Quickly glance at Areabase to see a brief description of the area you're in. It's as easy as that.</p>
                <p>The goals of Areabase are to create an easy to use way to query statistical data provided by the ONS and the Police Data service;
                to provide a one-click overview of the current area expressed using simple, understandable terms. Areabase adheres to the Android
                Design Guidelines, and is a fully-fledged Android application.</p>
                <h3>AreaRank <small>The new way of defining an area</small></h3>
                <p><img src="./images/arearank-card.png" class="img-thumbnail"/></p>
                <p><strong>AreaRank</strong> is a completely new way of estimating how good an area is based on Areabase's revolutionary algorithm.</p>
                <h3>Summary Generation <small>Read all about it</small></h3>
                <p>Areabase will generate a narrative <strong>summary</strong> of the Local Authority selected to give you the information you need,
                in a digestable format.</p>
                <h3>ONS Data <small>Finally something that works on touchscreens</small></h3>
                <p>Let's face it, the ONS web application sucks on PCs and sucks even more on mobiles. Areabase aims to fix the mobile bit.</p>

                <h3>Getting Areabase</h3>
                <p>Areabase can be installed via the Google Play Store. Simply click the link below, and press "Install", then accept the app permissions. If you are on
                a non-Android device, you will be asked to send the app to a device you wish to install it on.</p>

                <p>A narrative description of your area of choice.</p>

                <img class="img-responsive pull-right col-xs-6" src="./images/summary-view-framed.png"/>
                <h2>This is the Summary View</h2>
                <p>At the top, you can see the Action Bar: this will allow you to open up the Navigation Drawer by clicking on the application icon, load the 
                area for the current location, search for areas (by name fragment or postcode), refresh the current view, and see other options.</p>
                <p>You will be able to quickly read through an automatically generated summary of the statistical information of the open area. 
                The following sections should be available for each area: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>People</strong>, for demographic data</li>
                    <li><strong>Crime</strong>, for the crime rate and the most common type</li>
                    <li><strong>Economy</strong>, for unemployment and biggest sector</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment</strong>, for energy use and area type</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If all of these sections are present, <strong>AreaRank</strong> will also be generated and displayed on its own card.</p>
                <p>Summaries tend to take a while to generate, especially if the area has not been visited before. The map will only zoom in after the process 
                has completed, so you may see a zoomed-out map of the UK.</p>
                <p>Due to the limitations of the UK's Office for National Statistics Neighbourhood Data Exchange datasets, the app can only show you data 
                about Local Authorities &ndash; I tried to make it more detailed, however datasets are inconsistent across levels.</p>
                <p>The summary is generated based on statistical information provided by the 
                <a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/hub/index.html">UK National Statistics</a> and <a href="http://data.police.uk/">police data</a> services. 
                While I tried to make sure Areabase uses most up-to-date information, the ONS rarely provides "fresh" data through their API.</p>

                <h3>Loading areas</h3>
                <p>The application will, by default, load the first area by itself, based on the device's location as given by the Google Play location services. 
                While this is usually accurate and fast, sometimes the location given may not necessarily be what you are looking for.</p>
                <p>In order to load an area based on the location, click the <strong>Locate</strong> button on the Action Bar. You can also look for areas 
                by their name or part of their name, or by a known postcode &ndash; click the <strong>Search</strong> icon and enter your query into the 
                text box, then press "Search" or "Enter" on your keyboard (screen or hardware).</p>

                <p>To see other options, swipe from the left side of the screen, or click the application icon in the Action Bar. This will bring up the 
                <strong>Navigation Drawer</strong>, from which you can access other areas of the application:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Summary</strong>: will take you back to the Summary View from any other view.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crime</strong>: a shortcut to the Crime and Safety Subject View.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economy</strong>: a shortcut to the Economic Deprivation Subject View.</li>
                    <li><strong>Environment</strong>: a shortcut to the Physical Environment Subject View.</li>
                    <li><strong>Office for National Statistics</strong>: will take you to a list of Subjects available for the area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Police.uk</strong>: will take you to a graph of the criminal incidents reported in the area within the last 12 months.</li>

                    <p>Statistical data is best viewed on a graph. This is what Areabase delivers with its Graph Views.</p>
                    <p>To enter Graph View, you need to select a viable dataset in Subject View and click the blue "Graph this data" link. A new window will open, 
                    where you can change the time period for which the graph is displayed &ndash; note that for many datasets, only one period is available.</p>
                    <p>To return to Subject View, press the system <strong>Back button</strong>.</p>
                    <h3>Action Bar in the graph window</h3>
                    <p>Because the Graph View is displayed in another Activity (window), the action bar looks a bit different &ndash; for instance, you will not 
                    be able to open the <strong>Navigation Drawer</strong> here, or change the area, or refresh the view. To do that, you will need to go back 
                    to the main Activity.</p>
                    <h3>Known issues with the Graph View</h3>
                    <p>The main issue at the moment is that the labels on the graph do not display correctly. These screenshots show the ideal graph: 
                    short labels, and the total column is omitted. In many cases, the ONS variable names are too long to properly display on the graph, and 
                    totals cannot be easily excluded, as they do not have regular names (or, less commonly, variables that should go on the graph have 
                    names that may make an algorithm exclude them).</p>
